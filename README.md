# rust-thing
have python 3.11 and rust installed for this to work.

this is a ssimple command prompt emulator that works with github, some of the python scripts will print the repos and the members of the repos in a org.
while others will download the profile pictures of everyone who shows up in the controbution in each repo in a org.

rust is hard to read, litery. i spent around 2 hours trying to figure out what 5 LINES of code did.
